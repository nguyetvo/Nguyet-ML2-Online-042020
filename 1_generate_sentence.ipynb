        "# Text Generation using Bidirectional LSTM and Doc2Vec models\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of [this article](https://medium.com/@david.campion/text-generation-using-bidirectional-lstm-and-doc2vec-models-1-3-8979eb65cb3a) is to discuss about text generation, using machine learning approaches, especially neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is not the first article about it, and probably not the last. Actually, there is a lot of litterature about text generation using \"AI\" techniques, and some codes are available to generate texts from existing novels, trying to create new chapters for **\"Game of Thrones\"**, **\"Harry Potter\"**, or a new piece in the style of **Shakespears**. Sometimes with interesting results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mainly, these approaches are using classic LSTM networks, and the are pretty fun to be experimented.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, generated texts provide a taste of unachievement. Generated sentences seems quite right, whith correct grammar and syntax, as if the neural network was understanding correctly the structure of a sentence. But the whole new text does not have great sense. If it is not complete nosense. \n",
        "\n",
        "This problem could come from the approach itself, using only LSTM to generate text word by word. But how can we improve them ? In this article, I will try to investigate a new way to generate sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "It does not mean that I will use something completely different from LTSM : I am not, I will use LTSM network to generate sequences of words. However I will try to go further than a classic LSTM neural network and I will use an additional neural network (LSTM again), to select the best phrases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, this article can be used as a tutorial. It describes :\n",
        " 1. **how to train a neural network to generate sentences** (i.e. sequences of words), based on existing novels. I will use a bidirectional LSTM Architecture to perform that.\n",
        " 2. **how to train a neural network to select the best next sentence for given paragraph** (i.e. a sequence of sentences). I will also use a bidirectional LSTM archicture, in addition to a Doc2Vec model of the target novels.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Note about Data inputs\n",
        "As data inputs, I will not use texts which are not free in term of intellectual properties. So I will not train the solution to create a new chapter for **\"Game of Throne\"** or **\"Harry Potter\"**.\n",
        "Sorry about that, there is plenty of \"free\" text to perform such texts generation exercices and we can dive into the [Gutemberg project](http://www.gutenberg.org), which provides huge amount of texts (from [William Shakespears](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/65) to [H.P. Lovecraft](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/34724), or other great authors).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, I am also a french author of fantasy and Science fiction. So I will use my personnal material to create a new chapter of my stories, hoping it can help me in my next work!\n",
        "\n",
        "So, I will base this exercice on **\"Artistes et Phalanges\"**, a french fantasy novel I wrote over the 10 past years, wich I hope will be fair enough in term of data inputs. It contains more than 830 000 charaters.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the way, if you're a french reader and found of fantasy, you can find it on iBook store and Amazon Kindle for free... Please note I provide also the data for free on my github repository. Enjoy it!\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. a Neural Network for Generating Sentences\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step is to generate sentences in the style of a given author.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is huge litterature about it, espacially using LSTM to perform such task. As this kind of network are working well for this job, we will use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this note is not to deep dive into LSTM description, you can find very great article about them and I suggest you to read [this article](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) from Andrej Karpathy.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also find easily existing code to perform text generation using LSTM. On my github, you can find two tutorials, one using [Tensorflow](https://github.com/campdav/text-rnn-tensorflow), and another one using [Keras](https://github.com/campdav/text-rnn-keras) (over tensorflow), that is easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this first part of these exercice, I will re-use these materials, but with few improvements :\n",
        " - Instead of a simple _LSTM_, I will use a _bidirectional LSTM_. This network configuration converge faster than a single LSTM (less epochs are required), and from empiric tests, seems better in term of accuracy. You can have a look at [this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-bidirectional-lstm-sequence-classification-python-keras/) from Jason Brownlee, for a good tutorial about bidirectional LSTM.\n",
        " - I will use Keras, which require less complexity to create the network of is more readible than conventional Tensorflow code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1. What is the neural network task in our case ?\n",
        "\n",
        "LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) are very good for analysing sequences of values and predicting the next values from them. For example, LSTM could be a very good choice if you want to predict the very next point of a given time serie (assuming a correlation exist in the sequence).\n",
        "\n",
        "Talking about sentences and texts ; phrases (sentences) are basically sequences of words. So, it is natural to assume LSTM could be usefull to generate the next word of a given sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the objective of a LSTM neural network in this situation is to guess the next word of a given sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "What is the next word of this following sentence : \"he is walking down the\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Our neural net will take the sequence of words as input : \"he\", \"is\", \"walking\", ...\n",
        "Its ouput will be a matrix providing the probability for each word from the dictionnary to be the next one of the given sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, how will we build the complete text ? Simply iterating the process, by switching the setence by one word, including the new guessed word at its end. Then, we guess a new word for this new sentence. ad vitam aeternam.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1.1. Process\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to do that, first, we build a dictionary containing all words from the novels we want to use.\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. read the data (the novels we want to use),\n",
